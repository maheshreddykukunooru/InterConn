Message Threads
    -> every message must have a inicator saying whether its a parent of any thread ✔
    -> Working on getting the side column for threads. ✔
    -> Have to have another table to capture the reactions for the Thread Messages ✔

    -> Make sure to check with validations on both client and server side for Create channel,
        registration and other where ever there are forms.
    -> Image dimension ans size validation aswell to be taken care off ✔

    -> where there are nearly no messages in a channel, the very few mesages  present must be alligned to
        the bottom of the page.
